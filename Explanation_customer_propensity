Steps I followed when creating the model that shows a customerâ€™s propensity for joining the loyalty program:

1.	Stored the file into a data frame.

2.	Begin to perform analysis on the file such as determining if we have missing values.

3.	Generated numeric values for all of the categorical columns. This was done to ensure the model has the data 
    in the correct format for processing. 
    
4.	Reviewed statistical information to ensure the data was normalized before running this in a model. 

5.	Identify outliers and review the data of outliers to determine if I should make a change. I noticed that 
    I have negative values but I have quite a few of them so I decided to keep them instead of removing the rows. 
    
6.	Review more information about the data for loyal customers with positive transactions and those with 
    negative transactions. 
    
7.	Create my X and Y variables
8.	Create a correction table to see if any of my variables are correlated before using 
    them in the model (they are not correclated). 
    
9.	Create your X and Y test/train spilt that will be used with the models

10.	Generate three models: 
    a.	 Logistic regression
    b.	Decision Tree
    c.	Stochastic gradient descent
    
The models will help determine if the likely hood of customer propensity to join the loyalty program.
